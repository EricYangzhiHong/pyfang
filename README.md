pyfang
======

Union-based SQL injection tool in Python

SYNOPSIS
Currently finishing up the basic functionality of pyfang -- it's a class
project that I hope to continue afterwards. So far I've learned a lot about
basic SQLI.

DESCRIPTION
Pyfang is an Union-based SQL injector. After finding a potentially vulnerable
section of a web page, point pyfang to the appropriate IP, file, and variable
and it will do the rest.

NB: Pyfang requires BeautifulSoup. In Linux, it should be easy enough to 
pip install it.
